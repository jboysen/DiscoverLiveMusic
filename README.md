Discover Live Music

The main purpose of this app will be to easily show the nearby concerts today and the coming days. Eventful.com is a database of live music events (and other kinds of events) which has an open API that easily can be used. The events should be shown in lists and maps, and it should be possible to get more details about each event by clicking it. The deatils include date and time of event, venue, specific details about the artist (preferably retrieved from last.fm), maybe ability to listen to tracks by the artist (again through last.fm or maybe Spotify), the distance from the current destination to the venue, ability to create reminders in the native Reminder app directly, ability to share the event through email, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

The API from last.fm also allows to retrieve the recommended artists for a user based on already listened music - Spotify might have this feature as well - use this in a functionality where recommended artists are looked up at Eventful.com.
